			<h2>Code generation and a domain-specific language for Riemann solvers</h2>
			<img src="/img/riemann_solution.png" height=300 class="floatRight">
			<p>Modern numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws rely heavily on the use of approximate Riemann solvers
			in order to deal with discontinuities (shock waves) that arise in solutions.  Indeed, the Riemann solver is 
			usually the only part of the code that needs to be changed in order to model different physical wave phenomena
			like sound waves, water waves electromagnetic waves, and compressible fluids.</p>
			
			<p>It is therefore highly desirable
			to encapsulate the Riemann solver routine behind a modular interface that separates it from the rest of the code.
			This naturally leads to the possibility of also hiding the details of the Riemann solver implementation, and
			automatically adapting them for the solution of different equations or for efficient computation on different
			architectures.  Indeed, many Riemann solvers exhibit high
			arithmetic intensity and are therefore ideally suited to implementation on GPUs and manycore architectures in 
			which memory bandwidth and latency are the primary bottlenecks.</p>

			<p>This project aims to develop a domain-specific language for Riemann solvers, and use that language as the
			basis for automatic code generation in order to enable
			<ul>
				<li>Rapid prototyping of new applications by the use of a simple, intuitive interface for specifying a system of hyperbolic conservation laws</li>
				<li>Fast solution computation on GPU and manycore architectures</li>
			</ul>
			Some initial work in this direction has been created in the form of Andy Terrel's <a href="ignition">ignition package</a>, but
			the existing implementation has only very basic capabilities and is not properly incorporated into a complete conservation
			law solver.  This project will involve fleshing out the domain-specific language, implementing a capability for generating
			linear and nonlinear Riemann solvers compatible with <a href="http://clawpack.github.io">Clawpack</a>, and creating backends
			that generate performant code on selected architectures.  The resulting tool will offer both faster application development
			and better performance than existing software for hyperbolic conservation laws.</p>
