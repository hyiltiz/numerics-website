			<h2>Open Positions</h2>
			<p>We have multiple positions open for postdoctoral researchers and doctoral students.  Areas of particular interest are listed below, but outstanding candidates with relevant expertise are encouraged to apply even if their interests do not fit specifically into one of the projects below.</p>

			<h2>Postdoctoral fellowships</h2>
			<p>All postdoctoral positions listed are for an initial period of 1 year, with expected renewal for up to 3 years.  Fellows will work with the numerical mathematics group at KAUST and with international collaborators.  A publication record demonstrating excellent research skills is required, as well as excellent written and verbal communication skills.  These positions have no required teaching duties, but
			fellows	may be given teaching opportunities if desired.</p>

				<h3>Positivity preserving numerical methods</h3>
				<h4>Postdoctoral fellowship</h4>
				<strong>Description.</strong>  This project aims at developing numerical methods that ensure positivity of the solution for
				problems including population dynamics, chemical kinetics, fluid dynamics and shallow water waves.
				Existing numerical methods will be analyzed to understand their properties with respect to positivity,
				and new methods will be developed that maintain positivity under general conditions and large step sizes.
				The primary focus is on time integration methods (including Runge-Kutta and general linear methods), but
				development of new spatial discretization techniques may also be included.<br>
				
				<strong>Qualifications.</strong>  The applicant should have a strong background in numerical analysis and differential equations.  Expertise in any of the above-mentioned application areas is beneficial.

				<h3>Scientific Computing and Software Development</h3>
				<h4>Postdoctoral fellowship</h4>
				<strong>Description.</strong>  This project aims to further develop the PetClaw software for hyperbolic PDEs, including implementation of:
				<ul>
					<li>Three-dimensional wave propagation algorithms</li>
					<li>Parallel adaptive mesh refinement</li>
					<li>WENO reconstruction on mapped grids</li>
					<li>Genuinely multidimensional reconstruction on finite volumes</li>
					<li>Novel time integration methods</li>
				</ul>	
				<strong>Qualifications.</strong>  The applicant should have a strong background in scientific computing and PDE codes, including experience working in collaborative software development.  A strong understanding of Unix and multiple programming languages is mandatory (Fortran and Python are especially beneficial).  Expertise with software engineering tools and techniques like version control, automated testing, and build systems is helpful.

			<h2>Ph.D. Fellowships</h2>
			Outstanding applicants are invited to apply for a Ph.D. fellowship within the Numerical Mathematics Group.
			Please <a href=mailto:david.ketcheson@kaust.edu.sa>contact us by e-mail</a> as you submit your application 
			through the <a href="http://www.kaust.edu.sa/admissions/admissions.html"> KAUST admissions website</a>.
			You should include a sample publication or other demonstration of your technical writing.<br>
			
			Potential thesis topics include all areas of research mentioned on our <a href="research.html">Research page.</a>
			A degree in mathematics (applied or pure), physics, engineering, or a related field is required, as are  
			excellent written and verbal English communication skills. <br>
			
			Applicants possessing a Master’s degree will begin the Ph.D. program immediately, while applicants with a Bachelor’s degree 
			only will be expected to complete KAUST Master’s degree requirements first.  KAUST students receive a competitive stipend, 
			as well as benefits including housing and insurance.  Students in our group are provided with generous professional travel funding
			for conferences and collaborative work.<br>
			
			Students in our group interact closely with collaborators at international partner institutions and present results of their work at
			major international conferences.  No teaching duties are required of KAUST Ph.D. students, although teaching opportunities
			may be provided if desired.
