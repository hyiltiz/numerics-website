			<h2>Ph.D. Fellowships</h2>
			<p>Outstanding students with a BS or MS are invited to apply for a Ph.D. fellowship within the Numerical Mathematics Group.
			Please <a href=mailto:david.ketcheson@kaust.edu.sa>contact us by e-mail</a> as you submit your application 
			through the <a href="http://www.kaust.edu.sa/admissions/admissions.html"> KAUST admissions website</a>.
			You should include a sample publication or other demonstration of your research and writing.<br>
			
			Potential thesis topics include all areas of research mentioned on our <a href="/research.html">Research page.</a>
			A degree in mathematics (applied or pure), physics, engineering, or a related field is required, as are  
			excellent written and verbal English communication skills. <br>
			
			Applicants possessing a Master’s degree will begin the Ph.D. program immediately, while applicants with a Bachelor’s degree 
			only will be expected to complete KAUST Master’s degree requirements first.  KAUST students receive a competitive stipend, 
			as well as benefits including housing and insurance.  Students in our group are provided with generous professional travel funding
			for conferences and collaborative work.<br>
			
			Students in our group interact closely with collaborators at international partner institutions and present results of their work at
			major international conferences.  No teaching duties are required of KAUST Ph.D. students, although teaching opportunities
			may be provided if desired.</p>
