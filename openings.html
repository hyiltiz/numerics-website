			<h2>Open Positions</h2>
			<p>We have multiple positions open for postdoctoral researchers and doctoral students.  Areas of particular interest are listed below, but outstanding candidates with relevant expertise are encouraged to apply even if they do not fit specifically into one of the descriptions below.</p>

			<h2>Postdoctoral fellowships</h2>
			<p>All postdoctoral positions listed are for an initial period of 1 year, with expected renewal for up to 3 years.  Fellows will work with the numerical mathematics group at KAUST and with international collaborators.  A publication record demonstrating excellent research skills is required, as well as excellent written and verbal communication skills.  These positions have no required teaching duties, but
			fellows	may be given teaching opportunities if desired.</p>

				<h3>Positivity preserving numerical methods</h3>
				<h4>Postdoctoral fellowship</h4>
				<strong>Description.</strong>  This project aims at developing numerical methods that ensure positivity of the solution for
				problems including population dynamics, chemical kinetics, fluid dynamics and shallow water waves.
				Existing numerical methods will be analyzed to understand their properties with respect to positivity,
				and new methods will be developed that maintain positivity under general conditions and large step sizes.
				The primary focus is on time integration methods (including Runge-Kutta and general linear methods), but
				development of new spatial discretization techniques may also be included.<br>
				
				<strong>Qualifications.</strong>  The applicant should have a strong background in numerical analysis and differential equations.  Expertise in any of the above-mentioned application areas is beneficial.

				<h3>Scientific Computing and Software Development</h3>
				<strong>Description.</strong>  This project aims to further develop the PetClaw software for hyperbolic PDEs, including implementation of:
				<ul>
					<li>Three-dimensional wave propagation algorithms</li>
					<li>Parallel adaptive mesh refinement</li>
					<li>WENO reconstruction on mapped grids</li>
					<li>Genuinely multidimensional reconstruction on finite volumes</li>
					<li>Novel time integration methods</li>
				</ul>	
				<strong>Qualifications.</strong>  The applicant should have a strong background in scientific computing and PDE codes, including experience working in collaborative software development.  A strong understanding of Unix and multiple programming languages is mandatory (Fortran and Python are especially beneficial).  Expertise with software engineering tools and techniques like version control, automated testing, and build systems is helpful.

			<h2>Ph.D. Fellowships</h2>
			Outstanding applicants are invited to apply for a Ph.D. fellowship in the area of numerical analysis and scientific computing.  
			Potential Ph.D. projects include all areas of research mentioned on our <a href="research.html">Research page.</a>
			
			The applicant should have a degree in mathematics (applied or pure), physics, engineering, or a related field.  Applicants possessing a Master’s 
			degree will begin the Ph.D. program immediately, while applicants with a Bachelor’s degree only will be expected to complete 
			Master’s degree requirements first.  The fellowship will include a competitive stipend and generous travel funding for conferences, 
			as well as benefits including housing and insurance.
			
			The successful applicant will interact closely with collaborators at
			international partner institutions, and will be expected to present results at
			major international conferences.  There are no teaching duties associated with this position, although successful applicants 
			may be given teaching opportunities if desired.
			
			Please apply through the KAUST admissions website, and reference my group in your application.

				<p>This area uses the div class="half". You can replace it with two div:s if you give them class="quarter" to get a 4-column footer, or replace the two following div:s with one div with class="lasthalf" to get a 2-column footer.
