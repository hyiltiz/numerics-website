			<h2>Open Positions</h2>
			<p>We have multiple positions open for postdoctoral researchers and doctoral students.  Areas of particular interest are listed below, but outstanding candidates with relevant expertise are encouraged to apply even if their interests do not fit specifically into one of the projects below.</p>

			<a name="phd-fellowships"></a>
			<h2>Ph.D. Fellowships</h2>
			<p>Outstanding applicants are invited to apply for a Ph.D. fellowship within the Numerical Mathematics Group.
			Please <a href=mailto:david.ketcheson@kaust.edu.sa>contact us by e-mail</a> as you submit your application 
			through the <a href="http://www.kaust.edu.sa/admissions/admissions.html"> KAUST admissions website</a>.
			You should include a sample publication or other demonstration of your technical writing.<br>
			
			Potential thesis topics include all areas of research mentioned on our <a href="/research.html">Research page.</a>
			A degree in mathematics (applied or pure), physics, engineering, or a related field is required, as are  
			excellent written and verbal English communication skills. <br>
			
			Applicants possessing a Master’s degree will begin the Ph.D. program immediately, while applicants with a Bachelor’s degree 
			only will be expected to complete KAUST Master’s degree requirements first.  KAUST students receive a competitive stipend, 
			as well as benefits including housing and insurance.  Students in our group are provided with generous professional travel funding
			for conferences and collaborative work.<br>
			
			Students in our group interact closely with collaborators at international partner institutions and present results of their work at
			major international conferences.  No teaching duties are required of KAUST Ph.D. students, although teaching opportunities
			may be provided if desired.</p>
			
			<a name="postdoc-positions"></a>
			<h2>Postdoctoral fellowships</h2>
			<p>All postdoctoral positions listed are for an initial period of 1 year, with expected renewal for up to 3 years.  Fellows will work with the numerical mathematics group at KAUST and with international collaborators.  A publication record demonstrating excellent research skills is required, as well as excellent written and verbal communication skills.  These positions have no required teaching duties, but
			fellows	may be given teaching opportunities if desired.</p>
			<p>To apply, please send a CV, research statement, and contact information for
three references to <a href="mailto:david.ketcheson@kaust.edu.sa">david.ketcheson@kaust.edu.sa</a>.</p>

				<h3>Modeling wave propagation for seismic applications</h3>
				<h4>Postdoctoral fellowship</h4>
				<strong>Description.</strong>  This project focuses on the concept of inversion
				for seismic sources.  The goal is to produce efficient models for linear seismic
				waves and employ them in an inversion or optimization framework for seismic imaging
				 and enhanced oil recovery.<br>
				
				This project is part of KAUST's Academic Excellence Alliance with UT Austin, and 
				the fellow will work closely with geophysicists and mathematicians at KAUST and
				UT Austin.<br>
				
				<strong>Qualifications.</strong>  The applicant should have a strong background in numerical methods and wave equations, including experience in implementing and testing numerical methods.  Expertise in seismic modeling or inversion is beneficial but not required.

				<h3>Development of Scientific Software for Hyperbolic PDEs</h3>
				<h4>Postdoctoral fellowship</h4>
				<strong>Description.</strong>  This project aims to further develop the PetClaw software for hyperbolic PDEs, including implementation of:
				<ul>
					<li>Three-dimensional wave propagation algorithms</li>
					<li>Parallel adaptive mesh refinement</li>
					<li>WENO reconstruction on mapped grids</li>
					<li>Genuinely multidimensional reconstruction on finite volumes</li>
					<li>Novel time integration methods</li>
				</ul>
				The fellow will work primarily on integrating and testing these elements in an orthogonal 
				software framework.  The fellow will also collaborate with application scientists
				in applying these tools to electromagnetic and shallow water wave problems.
				<br>
				<strong>Qualifications.</strong>  The applicant should have a strong background in scientific computing and PDE codes, including experience working in collaborative software development.  A strong knowledge of Unix and multiple programming languages is mandatory (Fortran and Python are especially beneficial).  Expertise with software engineering tools and techniques like version control, automated testing, and build systems is helpful.  Knowledge of parallel computing environments and architectures is also beneficial.
