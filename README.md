================

Source for the website of the Numerical Mathematics Group at KAUST (http://numerics.kaust.edu.sa).
The site consists mainly of static HTML and CSS, based on a (heavily modified) template from Andreas Viklund.
A little bit of Python hackery is used for the news items and the publications page (see makesite.py).  The publications
list also relies on my library https://github.com/ketch/tex2_rst_html.

You are free to use the HTML and CSS files as a template for your own site.
