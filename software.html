			<h2>Software</h2>
			<body>In order for new numerical algorithms to have impact, they must be implemented in software
			that is both easy to use and powerful enough to solve interesting problems.  Computational science
			software development is an integral part of our research.  Below you will find brief descriptions
			of the major software packages developed within our group and with collaborators.</body><br><br>

				<body>PyClaw is a Python interface to the algorithms of Clawpack.  PetClaw is an extension of the PyClaw package yielding a massively parallel version of Clawpack, using PETSc, that is scalable to tens of thousands of processors.  PetClaw also provides access to the algorithms of SharpClaw (below) and is the recommended way to use them.  PyClaw was originally the work of Kyle Mandli.  PetClaw began life as the MS Thesis work of Amal Alghamdi and has become a powerful tool for studying hyperbolic PDEs.</body>

				<body>NodePy (Numerical ODEs in Python) is a Python package for designing, analyzing, and testing numerical methods for initial value ODEs. NodePy takes an object-oriented approach, in which the basic object is a numerical ODE solver (e.g., a Runge-Kutta or linear multistep method). It is intended to be a laboratory for such methods, with simple and intuitive methods of creating, modifying, and understanding them.
The package contains implementations of many things of general use for numerical analysts:
					<ul>
						<li>Methods for generating Runge-Kutta and linear multistep methods, including numerous individual methods and families.</li>
						<li>Methods for studying well-known and some less-common properties of methods, including strong stability preservation, contractivity, order stars, etc.</li>
						<li>Rooted trees and order conditions: the package contains a full imple- mentation of the Butcher group, including methods for plotting and computing products on rooted trees, as well as elementary weights and functions for generating and checking order conditions.</li>
						<li>Numerous additional classes of methods, including low-storage Runge- Kutta methods, multistep Runge-Kutta methods, embedded Runge- Kutta pairs, and more.</li>
						<li>The DETEST suite of initial value test problems, as well as a vari- ety of other problems and methods for automatically comparing the performance of any set of numerical methods in the solution of these problems.</li>

				<body>SharpClaw is a high-order accurate solver for general hyperbolic PDEs.  It uses the same kind of wave-propagation Riemann solvers as ClawPack, but is based on a method-of-lines approach.  It makes use of high order WENO reconstruction and Runge-Kutta methods to achieve high order accuracy.<br>

    SharpClaw has recently been integrated into PyClaw/PetClaw along with very high order WENO reconstruction through PyWENO code generation.  Downloading PyClaw is the recommended way to get the SharpClaw algorithms, and will allow you to run in parallel as well.</body><br><br>
